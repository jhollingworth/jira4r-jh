h1. jira4r

The current gem version of jira4r (0.3.0) is ancient. There is a more up to date version here http://xircles.rubyhaus.org/projects/jira4r so I have just cloned it so I can create my own gem of the source (jira4r-jh). Once a more up to date version of jira4r get's released I will remove this one.
