h1. jira4r

The current gem version of jira4r (0.3.0) is out of date. There is a more up to date version "here":http://xircles.rubyhaus.org/projects/jira4r. 
I have just cloned it to create my own gem of the source (jira4r-jh). Once a more up to date version of jira4r get's released I will remove this one.

h1. Examples

Detailed usage of the SOAP APIs can be found "here":https://docs.atlassian.com/rpc-jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/JiraSoapService.html
The usage is fairly straightforward but here are few examples to get you started.


h2. Login

bc.. client = Jira4R::JiraTool.new(2,your_jira_url) # 2 => jira soap api version, jira_url => base url
client.login(jira_username, jira_password)


h2. WorkLogs

bc.. worklog = Jira4R::V2::RemoteWorklog.new
worklog.startDate = JDate.today.to_s
worklog.timeSpent = '1h'
client.addWorklogAndAutoAdjustRemainingEstimate(your_jira_issue, worklog)

p. (Also see, *addWorklogAndRetainRemainingEstimate* and *addWorklogWithNewRemainingEstimate*)


h2. Updating Issues with Special Fields

p. If you use custom fields, you'll first need to create a "RemoteField":https://docs.atlassian.com/rpc-jira-plugin/latest/com/atlassian/jira/rpc/soap/beans/RemoteField.html object:

bc.. remote_field = Jira4R::V2::RemoteFieldValue.new
remote_field.id = "your_custom_field_id"
remote_field.values = "new_value"
client.updateIssue(your_jira_issue, [remote_field])
