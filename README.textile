h1. jira4r

The current gem version of jira4r (0.3.0) is ancient. There is a more up to date version here http://xircles.rubyhaus.org/projects/jira4r so I have just cloned it so I can create my own gem of the source (jira4r-jh). Once a more up to date version of jira4r get's released I will remove this one.

h1. Examples

h2. Login
client = Jira4R::JiraTool.new(2,your_jira_url)
client.login(jira_username, jira_password)

h2. Get a Jira Issue

client.getIssue(your_jira_issue)

h2. WorkLogs

worklog = Jira4R::V2::RemoteWorklog.new
worklog.startDate = JDate.today.to_s
worklog.timeSpent = '1h'

client.addWorklogAndAutoAdjustRemainingEstimate(your_jira_issue, worklog)

client.getWorklogs(your_jira_issue)
